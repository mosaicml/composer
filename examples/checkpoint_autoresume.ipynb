    "# ⏯️ Autoresume Training\n",
    "\n",
    "We all know the pain of having a training run die in the middle of training. Composer's autoresume feature provides a convenient solution to picking back up automatically from the last checkpoint when re-running a previously failed training script.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've put together this tutorial to demonstrate this feature in action and how you can activate it through the Composer trainer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial assumes you are familiar with the Composer trainer basics and its [saving/checkpointing features][checkpointing]. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial Goals and Concepts Covered\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to demonstrate autoresume by simulating a failed and re-run training script with the Composer trainer. More details on that below.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a deeper look into the way autoresume works, check out our more in depth [notes][autoresume].\n",

    "## Training Script\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use the block of code below as our training script. Autoresume comes in handy when training gets interrupted for some reason (say, your node dies). In those cases, being able to seamlessly pick up from your last checkpoint can be a huge time saver. We can simulate such a situation by manually interrupting our \"training script\" (the below cell) and re-running with autoresume!\n",
    "\n",
    "**To see this example in action, run this notebook twice.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first time the notebook is run, the trainer will save a checkpoint to the `save_folder` and train\n",
    "  for one epoch.\n",
    "* Any subsequent time the notebook is run, the trainer will resume from the latest checkpoint if using `autoresume=True`. If\n",
    "  the latest checkpoint was saved at ``max_duration``, meaning all training is finished, the Trainer will\n",
    "  exit immediately with an error that no training would occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the Trainer is configured with `autoresume=True`, it will automatically look for existing checkpoints and resume training. If no checkpoints exist, it'll start a new training run. This allows you to automatically resume from any faults, with no code changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate a flaky spot instance, try interrupting the notebook (e.g. Ctrl-C) midway through the\n",
    "first training run (say, after epoch 0 is finished). Notice how the progress bars resume at the next\n",
    "epoch and not repeat any training already completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature does not require code or configuration changes to distinguish between starting a new training\n",
    "run or automatically resuming from an existing one, making it easy to use Composer on preemptable cloud instances.\n",
    "Simply configure the instance to start Composer with the same command every time until training has finished!"
