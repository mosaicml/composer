    "Worry not! This just means everything is working as expected. With automatic microbatching enabled, Composer responds to OOM errors during training by halving the microbatch size. Under the hood, each minibatch is split into `n` \"microbatches\", where `n` is the accumulation rate, and gradients are accumulated across microbatches before stepping the optimizer. So, you should expect to see the microbatch size decrease and accumulation rate increase until the resulting microbatch size fits on the device. This lets you focus on getting the best *minibatch* size without having to stress about what your hardware can handle."
