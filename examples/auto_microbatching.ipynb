    "Have you ever wanted to choose your batch size **without** having to stress about CUDA Out-of-Memory (OOM) errors? We sure have. That's why we built Composer's automatic microbatching feature.\n",

    "### Tutorial Goals and Concepts Covered\n",

Under the hood, each minibatch is split into `n` \"microbatches\", where `n` is the accumulation rate, and gradients are accumulated across microbatches before stepping the optimizer. So, you should expect to see the microbatch size decrease and accumulation rate increase until the resulting microbatch size fits on the device.
