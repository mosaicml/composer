    "### Recommended Background\n",

    "For the sake of this tutorial, we won't assume you know much about Composer, but a quick read of the [Welcome Tour][welcome_tour] wouldn't hurt.\n",

    "* [An optimizer and learning rate scheduler](#optimizer-and-scheduler)\n",

    "We'll show how to [assemble these pieces and train with the Trainer](#train-a-baseline-model)\n",
