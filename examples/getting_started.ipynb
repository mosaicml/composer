    "\n",
    "Welcome to Composer! If you're wondering how this thing works, then you're in the right place. This is the first in our series of tutorials aimed at getting you familiar with the core concepts, capabilities, and patterns that make Composer such a useful tool!\n",

    "### Recommended Background\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of this tutorial, we won't assume you know much about Composer, but a quick read of the [Welcome Tour][welcome_tour] wouldn't hurt.\n",

    "Our focus here running this with the [Composer Trainer][trainer].\n",

    "* [An optimizer and learning rate scheduler](#optimizer-and-scheduler)\n",

    "We'll show how to [assemble these pieces and train with the Trainer](#train-a-baseline-model)\n",
