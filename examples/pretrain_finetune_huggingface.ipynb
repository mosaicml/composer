    "### Recommended Background\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have already gone through our [tutorial][huggingface] on finetuning a pretrained Hugging Face model with Composer, many parts of this tutorial will be familiar to you, but it is not necessary to do that one first.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial assumes you are familiar with transformer models for NLP and with Hugging Face.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the Composer part, make sure you're comfortable with the material in our [Getting Started][getting_started] tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial Goals and Concepts Covered\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to pretrain and finetune a Hugging Face transformer using the Composer library!\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspired by [this paper][downstream] showing that performing unsupervised pretraining on the downstream dataset can be surprisingly effective, we will focus on pretraining and finetuning a small version of [Electra][electra] on the [AG News][agnews] dataset!\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we will touch on:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Creating our Hugging Face model, tokenizer, and data loaders\n",
    "* Wrapping the Hugging Face model as a `ComposerModel` for use with the Composer trainer\n",
    "* Reloading the pretrained model with a new head for sequence classification\n",
    "* Training with Composer\n",
