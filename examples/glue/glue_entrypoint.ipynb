    "\n",
    "Some training workloads are more complex than others—for example, let's say you want to pre-train a language model and evaluate each of your pre-training checkpoints by fine-tuning it on all 8 GLUE tasks. Yeah, that sounds fairly complex, but many NLP researchers will recognize it as a standard chore, which is why we made a script to handle exactly this workload in Composer.\n",

    "This tutorial assumes that you are already familiar with NLP topics such as pre-training language models and fine-tuning on the GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation) benchmark.\n",
