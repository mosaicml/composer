    "This entrypoint allows you to specify if you want to pretrain a NLP model, finetune a model on the downstream tasks, or run the entire pipeline. If pretraining, the entrypoint will handle distributed training across all available GPUs. If fine-tuning, the entrypoint will fine-tune all given checkpoints on all 8 GLUE tasks in parallel using multiprocessing pools. This entrypoint is designed to make this process more efficient and remove the tediousness of individually spawning jobs and manually loading all the model checkpoints. "
