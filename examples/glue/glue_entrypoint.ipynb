    "This entry point allows you to specify if you want to pre-train a NLP model, fine-tune a model on the downstream tasks, or run the entire pipeline. If pre-training, the entry point will handle distributed training across all available GPUs. If fine-tuning, the entry point will fine-tune all given checkpoints on all 8 GLUE tasks in parallel using multiprocessing pools. This entry point is designed to make this process more efficient and remove the tediousness of individually spawning jobs and manually loading all the model checkpoints. "

See [TrainerHparams documentation](https://docs.mosaicml.com/en/stable/api_reference/composer.trainer.trainer_hparams.html?highlight=trainerhparams#composer.trainer.trainer_hparams.TrainerHparams) for more information about what is included in these parameters.\n"
