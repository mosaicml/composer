    "# ðŸ”Œ Training with TPUs\n",
    "\n",
    "Composer provides beta support for single core training on TPUs. We integrate with the `torch_xla` backend. For installation instructions and more details, see [here][torch_xla]. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is pretty straightforward. It uses the same basic training cycle set up in the [Getting Started][getting_started] tutorial, which you might want to check out first if you haven't already.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial Goals and Concepts Covered\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to show you the steps needed to do Composer training on TPUs. Concretely, we'll train a ResNet-20 on CIFAR10 using a single TPU core.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training setup is exactly the same as with any other device, except the model must be moved to the device before passing to our `Trainer`, where we must also specify `device=tpu` to enable the trainer to use TPUs. We'll touch on these steps below.\n",
