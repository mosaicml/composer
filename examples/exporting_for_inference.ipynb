    "# 🥡 Exporting for Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've trained using Composer, do you need to make your model available for inference? We've got you covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Composer provides model export support for inference using a dedicated export API and a callback. In this tutorial, we walk through how to export your models into various common formats (e.g., [ONNX][onnx] and [TorchScript][torchscript]) using the dedicated export API as well as Composer's callback mechanism. Composer models can also be exported like any other PyTorch module since Composer models are `torch.nn.Module` instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detailed options and configuration settings, please consult the linked documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial assumes that you're familiar with basic export formats like ONNX and TorchScript, and that you're generally up to speed on using Composer for training. If you haven't already, you may find it helpful to review our [callback docs][callback_docs] and [checkpointing docs][checkpointing_docs].\n",
