    "# 🛑 Early Stopping\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we're going to learn about how to perform early stopping in Composer using **callbacks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Composer, callbacks modify trainer behavior and are called at the relevant Events in the training loop. This tutorial focuses on two callbacks, the [EarlyStopper][earlystopper] and [ThresholdStopper][thresholdstopper], both of which halt training early depending on different criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial assumes that you're generally familiar with techniques such as early stopping.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also be comfortable with the material in the [Getting Started tutorial][getting_started] before you embark on this slightly more advanced tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you'll probably have a better intuition for how the demonstrated features work if you brush up on Composer's event-driven design in our [Welcome Tour][welcome_tour].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial Goals and Concepts Covered\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to demonstrate a basic training run using one of our callbacks to control if/when training stops before the maximum training duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll demonstrate:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Basic training setup with Composer](#setup)\n",
    "* [Using the EarlyStopper](#earlystopper), and\n",
    "* [Using the ThresholdStopper](#thresholdstopper)\n",
    "\n",
    "A comprehensive overview of Composer callbacks is outside the scope of this tutorial, but this should introduce you to some useful tools and give you a sense for the ways callbacks can be used to modify training behavior.\n",
