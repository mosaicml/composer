By default, the train dataloader is labeled `train`, and the evaluation dataloader is labeled `eval`. (These names can be customized via the `train_dataloader_label` in the [Trainer](https://docs.mosaicml.com/en/stable/api_reference/composer.trainer.trainer.html#composer.trainer.trainer.Trainer) or the `label` argument of the [Evaluator](https://docs.mosaicml.com/en/stable/api_reference/composer.core.evaluator.html?highlight=Evaluator#composer.core.evaluator.Evaluator), respectively.)\n",

    "-   `min_delta`: If non-zero, the change in the tracked metric over the `patience` window must be at least this large.\n",
