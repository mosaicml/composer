    "### Recommended Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial assumes you are familiar with transformer models for NLP and with Hugging Face.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to fine-tune a pretrained Hugging Face transformer using the Composer library!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on fine-tuning a pretrained BERT-base model on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank v2 (SST-2) dataset. After fine-tuning, the BERT model should be able to determine if a sentence has positive or negative sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we will touch on:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Creating our Hugging Face BERT model, tokenizer, and data loaders\n",
    "* Wrapping the Hugging Face model as a `ComposerModel` for use with the Composer trainer\n",
    "* Training with Composer\n",
    "* Visualization examples\n",
