    "In practice, a lot of deep learning training happens in environments where servers lack persistent local storage. Thankfully, Composer is designed to natively support training in such contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without local persistent storage, checkpoints and datasets will need to be downloaded from the cloud, and all checkpoints, logs, metrics, and other artifacts will need to be backed up directly to the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "Composer can automatically load checkpoints from cloud storage, convert traditional datasets into a format that can be streamed in when training, and asynchronously back up checkpoints and other artifacts without blocking the training loop. This tutorial will illustrate how.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of our most advanced tutorials. You'll want to have some good familiarity with Composer, in particular [checkpointing][checkpointing] and [dataloaders][dataloaders]. You may even want to first explore our [streaming dataloader][streaming] tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, this tutorial assumes that you are familiar with cloud storage concepts, such as saving artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial Goals and Concepts Covered\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to give you an in-depth look at a training workflow that does not require peristent local storage. To that end, we'll walk through how to convert a local training workflow for an MNIST classifier into one that does not require persistent disks.\n",
    "\n",
    "_In reality, small models with datasets that converge quicklyâ€”like MNISTâ€”would likely not require streaming datasets, since it's usually fast enough to download all data at the start of training. However, this is a simple example that highlights the steps involved to use these features in Composer._\n",

Not all `LoggerDestination`s support storing all types of data; for example, the [ObjectStoreLogger][ObjectStoreLogger] only supports logging artifacts, whereas the [FileLogger][FileLogger] only supports logging files. Others, such as the [WandBLogger][wandb], support both.\n",
