    "# ⚡ Migrating from PTL\n",
    "\n",
    "[PyTorch Lightning][ptl] is a popular and well-designed framework for training deep neural networks. You can use Composer's algorithms in your Pytorch Lightning code via the [functional API](https://docs.mosaicml.com/en/stable/functional_api.html) with no additional code changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you are interested in features like [automatic gradient accumulation](https://docs.mosaicml.com/en/stable/examples/auto_grad_accum.html), a [clean time abstraction](https://docs.mosaicml.com/en/stable/trainer/time.html), and the easiest path to trying out different combinations of algorithms, you will need to switch from the PTL trainer to the Composer trainer.\n",
