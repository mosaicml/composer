    "\n",
    "Itching to use optimized data loading systems like [FFCV][ffcv]? This tutorial will show you how to do so with Composer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Background\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of this tutorial, we'll assume you're already familiar with the FFCV library. If not, you can still use this tutorial as a starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we're assuming that you're already familiar with the basics of setting up training loops in both PyTorch and Composer. You may want to review the [Getting Started][getting_started] tutorial to brush up on those basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial Goals and Covered Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to walk you through an example of using FFCV dataloaders with the Composer training loop. For the sake of demonstration, we'll show the training loop twice—first with PyTorch dataloaders (as a baseline) and then with FFCV dataloaders for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using the CIFAR-10 dataset for demonstration purposes but you can use ImageNet-1K (and others) as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This notebook may not work in Google colab due to FFCV's requirement for Python >= 3.8 and Google colab running Python 3.7 as of May 15, 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Another Note**: To get the most out of FFCV with Composer, you'll need to run `ffcv_monkey_patches()` once in the start of your training script. More detail [below](#use-ffcv-dataloaders-to-speed-up-training).\n",
