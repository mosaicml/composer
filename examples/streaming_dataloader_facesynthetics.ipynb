    "# ðŸŽ¢ FaceSynthetics with Streaming Dataloader\n",
    "\n",
    "Why wait for your data to download when you can stream it instead? Let's see how to do so with Composer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Streaming is useful for multi-node setups where workers don't have persistent storage and each element of the dataset must be downloaded exactly once. In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate a streaming approach to loading our datasets, using Microsoft's FaceSynthetics dataset as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial assumes that you're reasonably familiar with the workings of datasets and dataloaders for training deep learning models. In addition, since we'll be building from a computer vision example, familiarity in that area will likely be useful as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're already familiar with Composer's streaming dataset classes ([StreamingDataset][streaming_dataset] and [StreamingDatasetWriter][streaming_dataset_writer]), that's great. If not, you may want to pause while working through the tutorial and look at the docs referenced along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial Goals and Concepts Covered\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to showcase how to prepare and use Composer's streaming data loading tools. It will consist of a few steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Obtaining the dataset\n",
    "2. Preparing the dataset for streaming <br/>\n",
    "    a. (Optionally) uploading the dataset to a server\n",
    "3. Streaming the dataset to the local machine\n",
    "4. Training a model using these datasets\n",
