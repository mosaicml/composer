# **üëã Welcome**

Composer is an open-source deep learning training library by [MosaicML](https://www.mosaicml.com/). Built on top of PyTorch, the Composer library makes it easier to implement distributed training workflows on large-scale clusters.

We built Composer to be **optimized for scalability and usability**, integrating best practices for efficient, multi-node training. By abstracting away low-level complexities like parallelism techniques, distributed data loading, and memory optimization, you can focus on training modern ML models and running experiments without slowing down.

We recommend using Composer to speedup your experimentation workflow if you‚Äôre training neural networks of any size, including:

- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Diffusion models
- Embedding models (e.g. BERT)
- Transformer-based models
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Composer is heavily used by the MosaicML research team to train state-of-the-art models like MPT, and we open-sourced this library to enable the ML community to do the same. This framework is used by organizations in both the tech industry and the academic sphere and is continually updated with new features, bug fixes, and stability improvements for production workloads.

# **üîë¬†Key Features**
![Composer is to give you better workflows with the ability to maximize scale and customizability.](docs/source/_static/images/key_features.png)

We designed Composer from the ground up for modern deep learning workloads. Gone are the days of AlexNet and ResNet, when state-of-the-art models could be trained on a couple of desktop GPUs. Today, developing the latest and greatest deep learning models often requires cluster-scale hardware ‚Äî but with Composer‚Äôs help, you‚Äôll hardly notice the difference.

The heart of Composer is our Trainer abstraction: a highly optimized PyTorch training loop designed to allow both you and your model to iterate faster. Our trainer has simple ways for you to configure your parallelization scheme, data loaders, metrics, loggers, and more.

## Scalability

Whether you‚Äôre training on 1 GPU or 512 GPUs, 50MB or 10TB of data - Composer is built to keep your workflow simple.

- [**FSDP**](https://docs.mosaicml.com/projects/composer/en/stable/notes/distributed_training.html#fullyshardeddataparallel-fsdp): For large models that are too large to fit on GPUs, Composer has integrated PyTorch [FullyShardedDataParallelism](https://docs.mosaicml.com/projects/composer/en/stable/notes/distributed_training.html#fullyshardeddataparallel-fsdp) into our trainer and made it simple to efficiently parallelize custom models. We‚Äôve found FSDP is competitive performance-wise with much more complex parallelism strategies. Alternatively, Composer also supports standard PyTorch distributed data parallelism (DDP) and Deepspeed execution.
- [**Elastic sharded checkpointing**](https://docs.mosaicml.com/projects/composer/en/stable/notes/distributed_training.html#saving-and-loading-sharded-checkpoints-with-fsdp): Save on eight GPUs, resume on sixteen. Composer supports elastic sharded checkpointing, so you never have to worry if your sharded saved state is compatible with your new hardware setup.
- **Data streaming:** Working with large datasets? Download datasets from cloud blob storage on the fly by integrating with MosaicML [StreamingDataset](https://github.com/mosaicml/streaming) during model training.

## Customizability

Other high-level deep learning trainers provide simplicity at the cost of rigidity. When you want to add your own features, their abstractions get in your way. Composer, on the other hand, provides simple ways for you to customize our Trainer to your needs.

![Composer‚Äôs training loop has a series of events that occur at each stage in the training process.](docs/source/_static/images/traning_loop.png)

***Fig. 1:** Composer‚Äôs training loop has a series of events that occur at each stage in the training process. Callbacks are functions that users write to run at specific events. For example, our [Learning Rate Monitor Callback](https://docs.mosaicml.com/projects/composer/en/stable/api_reference/generated/composer.callbacks.LRMonitor.html#composer.callbacks.LRMonitor) logs the learning rate at every BATCH_END event.*

- [**Callbacks**](https://docs.mosaicml.com/projects/composer/en/stable/trainer/callbacks.html): Composer‚Äôs callback system allows you to insert custom logic at any point in the training loop. We‚Äôve written callbacks to monitor memory usage, log and visualize images, and estimate your model‚Äôs remaining training time, to name a few. This feature is popular among researchers who want to implement and experiment with custom training techniques.
- [**Speedup algorithms**](https://docs.mosaicml.com/projects/composer/en/stable/examples/custom_speedup_methods.html): We draw from the latest research to create a collection of algorithmic speedups. Stack these speedups into MosaicML recipes to boost your training speeds. Our team has open-sourced the optimal combinations of speedups for different types of models.
    - **8x speedup: Stable Diffusion**
        - $200k original SD2 cost ‚Äî> $50k ([Blog](https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/diffusion))
    - **7x speedup: ResNet-50 on ImageNet**
        - 3h33m ‚Äî> 25m on 8xA100 ([Blog](https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/mosaic-resnet))
    - **8.8x speedup: BERT-Base Pretraining**
        - 10h ‚Äî> 1.13h on 8xA100 ([Blog](https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/mosaicbert))
    - **5.4x speedup: DeepLab v3 on ADE20K**
        - 3h30m ‚Äî> 39m on 8xA100 ([Blog](https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/behind-the-scenes))

## Better workflows

Composer is built to automate away low-level pain points and headaches so you can focus on the important (and fun) parts of deep learning and iterate faster.

- [**Auto-resumption**](https://docs.mosaicml.com/projects/composer/en/stable/notes/resumption.html): Failed training run? Have no fear ‚Äî just re-run your code, and Composer will automatically resume from your latest saved checkpoint.
- [**CUDA OOM Prevention**](https://docs.mosaicml.com/projects/composer/en/stable/examples/auto_microbatching.html): Say goodbye to out-of-memory errors.  Set your microbatch size to ‚Äúauto‚Äù, and Composer will automatically select the biggest one that fits on your GPUs.
- **[Time Abstractions](https://docs.mosaicml.com/projects/composer/en/latest/trainer/time.html):** Ever messed up your conversion between update steps, epochs, samples, and tokens? Specify your training duration with custom units (epochs, batches, samples, and tokens) in your training loop with our `Time` class.

## Integrations

Integrate with the tools you know and love for experiment tracking and data streaming.

- **Cloud integrations**: Our Checkpointing and logging features have first-class support for remote storage and loading from Cloud bucket (OCI, GCP, AWS S3).
- **********Experiment tracking:********** Weights and Biases, MLFlow, and CometML ‚Äî the choice is yours, easily log your data to your favorite platform.

# **üöÄ Getting Started**

## **üìç**Prerequisites

Composer is designed for users who are comfortable with Python and have basic familiarity with deep learning fundamentals and PyTorch.

**********************************************Software requirements:**********************************************  A recent version of PyTorch.

<!--pytest.mark.filterwarnings(r'ignore:Some targets have less than 1 total probability:UserWarning')-->
<!--pytest.mark.filterwarnings('ignore:Cannot split tensor of length .* into batches of size 128.*:UserWarning')-->
```python
from torchvision import datasets, transforms
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

from composer import Trainer
from composer.models import mnist_model
from composer.algorithms import LabelSmoothing, CutMix, ChannelsLast

transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor()])
dataset = datasets.MNIST("data", train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
train_dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=128)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=mnist_model(num_classes=10),
    train_dataloader=train_dataloader,
    max_duration="2ep",
    algorithms=[
        LabelSmoothing(smoothing=0.1),
