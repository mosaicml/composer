"""The EfficientNet model family is a set of convolutional neural networks that can be used as the basis for a variety
of vision tasks, but were initially designed for image classification. The model family was designed to reach the
highest accuracy for a given computation budget during inference by simultaneously scaling model depth, model width, and
image resolution according to an empirically determined scaling law.

See the :doc:`Model Card </model_cards/efficientnet>` for more details.
