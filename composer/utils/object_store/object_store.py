class ObjectStoreTransientError(RuntimeError):
    """Custom exception class to signify transient errors.

    Implementations of the :class:`.ObjectStore` should re-raise any transient exceptions
    (e.g. too many requests, temporarily unavailable) with this class, so callers can easily
    detect whether they should attempt to retry any operation.

    For example, the :class:`.S3ObjectStore` does the following:

    .. testcode::

        from composer.utils import ObjectStore, ObjectStoreTransientError
        import botocore.exceptions

        class S3ObjectStore(ObjectStore):

            def upload_object(self, file_path: str, object_name: str):
                try:
                    ...
                except botocore.exceptions.ClientError as e:
                    if e.response['Error']['Code'] == 'LimitExceededException':
                        raise ObjectStoreTransientError(e.response['Error']['Code']) from e
                    raise e

    Then, callers can automatically handle exceptions:

    .. testcode::

        import time
        from composer.utils import ObjectStore, ObjectStoreTransientError

        def upload_file(object_store: ObjectStore, max_num_attempts: int = 3):
            for i in range(max_num_attempts):
                try:
                    object_store.upload_object(...)
                except ObjectStoreTransientError:
                    if i + 1 == max_num_attempts:
                        raise
                    else:
                        # Try again after exponential back-off
                        time.sleep(2**i)
                else:
                    # upload successful
                    return
