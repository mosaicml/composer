"""Helper methods for :mod:`torch.distributed`.

To use :mod:`torch.distributed`, launch your training script with the
:ref:`composer launcher for distributed training <distributed-training>`. For example,
the following command launches an eight-process training run.

.. code-block::

    composer -n 8 path/to/train.py

The composer launcher will automatically configure the following environment variables, which are
required for distributed training:

* ``RANK``: The global rank of the process, which should be on ``[0; WORLD_SIZE - 1]``.
* ``LOCAL_RANK``: The local rank for the process, which should be on ``[0; LOCAL_WORLD_SIZE - 1]``.
* ``NODE_RANK``: The rank of the node.
* ``WORLD_SIZE``: The total number of processes.
* ``LOCAL_WORLD_SIZE``: The number of processes on the current node.
* ``MASTER_ADDR``: The hostname for the rank-zero process.
* ``MASTER_PORT``: The port for the rank-zero process.

If none of these environment variables are set, this module will safely assume a single-rank configuration, where::

    RANK=0
    LOCAL_RANK=0
    NODE_RANK=0
    WORLD_SIZE=1
    LOCAL_WORLD_SIZE=1
