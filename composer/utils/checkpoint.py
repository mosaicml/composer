    Args:
        path (str): The path format string to an existing checkpoint file.

            It can be a path to a file on the local disk, a URL, or if ``object_store`` is set, the object name
            for a checkpoint in a cloud bucket.

            When using `Deepspeed ZeRO <https://www.deepspeed.ai/tutorials/zero/>`_, checkpoints are shareded by rank.
            Instead of hard-coding the rank in the ``path``, use the following format variables:

            +------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
            | Variable               | Description                                           |
            +========================+=======================================================+
            | ``{rank}``             | The global rank, as returned by                       |
            |                        | :func:`~.dist.get_global_rank`.                       |
            +------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
            | ``{local_rank}``       | The local rank of the process, as returned by         |
            |                        | :func:`~.dist.get_local_rank`.                        |
            +------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
            | ``{node_rank}``        | The node rank, as returned by                         |
            |                        | :func:`~.dist.get_node_rank`.                         |
            +------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+

            For example, suppose that checkpoints are stored in the following structure:

            .. code-block::

                my_model/ep1-rank0.tar
                my_model/ep1-rank1.tar
                my_model/ep1-rank2.tar
                ...

            Then, ``path`` should be set to ``my_model/ep1-rank{rank}.tar``, and all ranks will load the
            correct state.

        state (State): The :class:`~composer.core.State` to load the checkpoint into.
        object_store (Union[ObjectStore, LoggerDestination], optional): If the ``path`` is in an object store
            (i.e. AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage), an instance of
            :class:`~.ObjectStore` or :class:`~.LoggerDestination` which will be used
            to retreive the checkpoint. Otherwise, if the checkpoint is a local filepath, set to ``None``.
            (default: ``None``)
        load_weights_only (bool, optional): Whether or not to only restore the model weights from the checkpoint without
            restoring the associated state. (default: ``False``)
        strict_model_weights (bool, optional): Whether or not to force that the checkpointed weights must exactly
            match the model weights. (default: ``False``)
        progress_bar (bool, optional): Whether or not to show a progress bar when downloading checkpoints.
            Ignored if the checkpoint is a local file path. (default: ``True``)
        ignore_keys (List[str] | (Dict) -> None, optional): A list of paths for the ``state_dict`` of the checkpoint,
            which, when provided, will be ignored from the state_dict before a checkpoint is loaded. Each path is a list
            of strings specifying the keys to index into ``state_dict`` joined together with `/` as a seperator (as PyTorch
            uses `.` in parameter names). If a prefix is provided, all children are also ignored (see Example 2).
            See :mod:`composer.core.state` for the structure of state_dict.

            Example 1: ``ignore_keys = ["state/model/layer1.weights", "state/model/layer1.bias"]`` would ignore
            layer 1 weights and bias.

            Example 2: ``ignore_keys = ["state/model/*"]`` would ignore the entire model, which would have the same
            effect as the previous example if there was only 1 layer.

            Example 3: ``ignore_keys = ["state/model/layer*.weights"]`` would ignore all weights in the model.

            Example 4: ``ignore_keys = ["state/rank_zero_seed", "rng"]`` would reset all randomness when
            loading the checkpoint.

            If a callable, it should take one argument which is the state_dict. The callable is free to arbitrarily modify
            the state_dict before it is loaded.

            (default: ``None``)

    Returns:
        Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]]: The RNG state dicts, indexed by global rank, if
            :attr:`load_weights_only` is not None. Otherwise, None.

save_checkpoint.__doc__ = f"""Checkpoint the training ``state``.

Args:
    state (State): The training state.
    logger (Logger): The logger.
    filename (str): A format string describing how to name checkpoints.
        (default: ``'ep{{epoch}}-ba{{batch}}-rank{{rank}}'``)

        The following format variables are available:

        {textwrap.indent(FORMAT_NAME_WITH_DIST_AND_TIME_TABLE, prefix='        ')}

        .. note::

            *   By default, only the rank zero process will save a checkpoint file.

            *   When using DeepSpeed, each rank will save a checkpoint file in tarball format. DeepSpeed
                requires tarball format, as it saves model and optimizer states in separate files.
                Ensure that ``'{{rank}}'`` appears within the ``filename``. Otherwise, multiple ranks
                may attempt to write to the same file(s), leading to corrupted checkpoints. If no tarball file
                extension is specified, ``.tar`` will be used.

            *   To use compression (regardless of whether DeepSpeed is enabled), set the file extension
                to ``'.tar.gz'``, ``'.tgz'``, ``'.tar.bzip'``, or ``'.tar.lzma'`` (depending on the desired
                compression algorithm).

        .. warning::

            Using compression will block the training loop while checkpoints are being compressed. As such, we
            recommend saving checkpoints without compression.

        Consider the following scenario, where:

        *   The default ``name='ep{{epoch}}-ba{{batch}}-rank{{rank}}'`` is used.
        *   The current epoch count is ``1``.
        *   The current batch count is ``42``.

        When DeepSpeed is not being used, the rank zero process will save the checkpoint to ``'ep1-ba42-rank0'``.
        When DeepSpeed is being used, each rank (process) will save checkpoints to::

            ep1-ba42-rank0.tar
            ep1-ba42-rank1.tar
            ep1-ba42-rank2.tar
            ...

    weights_only (bool, optional): If ``True``, save only the model weights instead of the entire training state.
        (default: ``False``)

        .. note::

            When using DeepSpeed, this parameter must be ``False``. Weights-only checkpointing is not currently
            compatible with DeepSpeed,

    Returns:
        List[pathlib.Path]: The list of checkpoint files saved, indexed by the rank of the process.

        .. note::

            When using DeepSpeed, each process (rank) saves its own checkpoint file.
            When doing multi-node training, the filepaths are valid only on each process's node;
            Composer does not move checkpoint files between nodes.

            Otherwise, when not using DeepSpeed, each list will contain only one filepath,
            since only the rank zero process saves checkpoints.
