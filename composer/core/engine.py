"""Engine is a coordinator for running algorithms and resolving ordering conflicts among them for composition.

.. currentmodule:: composer

The order in which algorithms are run matters significantly during composition. For example,
:class:`~.SelectiveBackprop` algorithm runs on the :attr:`~.Event.AFTER_DATALOADER` event and must run before any data
augmentations.  :class:`~.engine.Engine` runs re-ordering passes to resolve such ordering issues or conflicts.

.. note::

    * An instance of :class:`~.engine.Engine` is automatically constructed by the :class:`~.trainer.Trainer`
      constructor. A user need not instantiate :class:`~.engine.Engine` class.

    * The design of :class:`~.engine.Engine` is subject to change in future releases to accommodate more complexity as
      we investigate composition of algorithms.


Currently, the following passes are registered:

* **LIFO order for events**

  For the events that follow the ``before_*`` (e.g., :attr:`~.Event.BEFORE_LOSS`) and ``after_*`` (e.g.,
  :attr:`~.Event.AFTER_LOSS`) pattern, the ordering of algorithms is reversed for the ``after_*`` events. For example,
  four given algorithms ``A``, ``B``, ``C`` and ``D`` will run in ``ABCD`` ordering on the ``before_*`` event while
  ``DCBA`` ordering on the ``after_*`` event.

  This allows algorithms to "clean up" their changes. For example, :class:`~.LabelSmoothing` will smooth the labels
  upon on :attr:`~.Event.BEFORE_LOSS` event and then restore the original unsmoothed labels on
  :attr:`~.Event.AFTER_LOSS` event.

* **Run Selective Backprop first**

  :class:`~.SelectiveBackprop` runs after the dataloader returns the batch, and executes an extra forward pass to rank
  and prune the examples in the batch by loss. To ensure a clean estimate of loss, :class:`~.SelectiveBackprop` should
  run before any other data augmentations (e.g., :class:`~.MixUp`) on the :attr:`~.Event.AFTER_DATALOADER` event.

Trace
~~~~~

Traces record whether an algorithm ran at a particular step and event combination and also the order of such executions.
These are logged with the key ``<algorithm_name>/<event>``.

For example, the algorithm :class:`~.LayerFreezing`, which runs at the end of every epoch on :attr:`~.Event.EPOCH_END`,
will emit a series of traces:

.. code-block::

   [STEP=0][layer_freezing/INIT=0]
   [STEP=1][layer_freezing/EPOCH_START=0]
   [STEP=1][layer_freezing/BATCH_START=0]
   ...
   [STEP=2][layer_freezing/BATCH_START=0]
   ...
   [STEP=3][layer_freezing/BATCH_START=0]
   ...
   [STEP=3][layer_freezing/EPOCH_END=1]  # <-- layer freezing ran on step 3 here!
