"""Reference for common types used throughout the composer library.

Attributes:
    Batch (Any): Alias to type Any.
        A batch of data can be represented in several formats, depending on the application.
    PyTorchScheduler (torch.optim.lr_scheduler._LRScheduler): Alias for base class of learning rate schedulers such
        as :class:`torch.optim.lr_scheduler.ConstantLR`.
    JSON (str | float | int | None | List['JSON'] | Dict[str, 'JSON']): JSON Data.

        CONTIGUOUS_FORMAT: Default PyTorch memory format represnting a tensor allocated with consecutive dimensions
            sequential in allocated memory.
        CHANNELS_LAST: This is also known as NHWC. Typically used for images with 2 spatial dimensions (i.e., Height and
            Width) where channels next to each other in indexing are next to each other in allocated memory. For example, if
            C[0] is at memory location M_0 then C[1] is at memory location M_1, etc.
        CHANNELS_LAST_3D: This can also be referred to as NTHWC. Same as :attr:`CHANNELS_LAST` but for videos with 3
            spatial dimensions (i.e., Time, Height and Width).
        PRESERVE_FORMAT: A way to tell operations to make the output tensor to have the same memory format as the input
            tensor.
