    Attributes:
        INIT: Invoked in the constructor of :class:`~.trainer.Trainer`. Model surgery (see
            :mod:`~composer.utils.module_surgery`) typically occurs here.
        AFTER_LOAD: Immediately after checkpoint is loaded in constructor of :class:`~.trainer.Trainer`.
        FIT_START: Invoked at the beginning of each call to :meth:`.Trainer.fit`. Dataset transformations typically
            occur here.
        EPOCH_START: Start of an epoch.
        BEFORE_DATALOADER: Immediately before the dataloader is called.
        AFTER_DATALOADER: Immediately after the dataloader is called.  Typically used for on-GPU dataloader transforms.
        BATCH_START: Start of a batch.
        BEFORE_TRAIN_BATCH: Before the forward-loss-backward computation for a training batch. When using gradient
            accumulation, this is still called only once.
        BEFORE_FORWARD: Before the call to ``model.forward()``.
            This is called multiple times per batch when using gradient accumulation.
        AFTER_FORWARD: After the call to ``model.forward()``.
            This is called multiple times per batch when using gradient accumulation.
        BEFORE_LOSS: Before the call to ``model.loss()``.
            This is called multiple times per batch when using gradient accumulation.
        AFTER_LOSS: After the call to ``model.loss()``.
            This is called multiple times per batch when using gradient accumulation.
        BEFORE_BACKWARD: Before the call to ``loss.backward()``.
            This is called multiple times per batch when using gradient accumulation.
        AFTER_BACKWARD: After the call to ``loss.backward()``.
            This is called multiple times per batch when using gradient accumulation.
        AFTER_TRAIN_BATCH: After the forward-loss-backward computation for a training batch. When using gradient
            accumulation, this event still fires only once.
        BATCH_END: End of a batch, which occurs after the optimizer step and any gradient scaling.
        BATCH_CHECKPOINT: After :attr:`.Event.BATCH_END` and any batch-wise evaluation. Saving checkpoints at this
            event allows the checkpoint saver to use the results from any batch-wise evaluation to determine whether
            a checkpoint should be saved.
        EPOCH_END: End of an epoch.
        EPOCH_CHECKPOINT: After :attr:`.Event.EPOCH_END` and any epoch-wise evaluation. Saving checkpoints at this
            event allows the checkpoint saver to use the results from any epoch-wise evaluation to determine whether
            a checkpointshould be saved.
        FIT_END: Invoked at the end of each call to :meth:`.Trainer.fit`. This event exists primarily for logging information
            and flushing callbacks. Algorithms should not transform the training state on this event, as any changes will not
            be preserved in checkpoints.

        EVAL_START: Start of evaluation through the validation dataset.
        EVAL_BATCH_START: Before the call to ``model.eval_forward(batch)``
        EVAL_BEFORE_FORWARD: Before the call to ``model.eval_forward(batch)``
        EVAL_AFTER_FORWARD: After the call to ``model.eval_forward(batch)``
        EVAL_BATCH_END: After the call to ``model.eval_forward(batch)``
        EVAL_END: End of evaluation through the validation dataset.
