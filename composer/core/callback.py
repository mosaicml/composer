    A callback is similar to an

    modify :class:`State`.

    Callbacks can be implemented in two ways:

    #. Override the individual methods named for each :class:`Event`.
        
    #. Override :meth:`_run_event` (**not** :meth:`run_event`) to run in response
       to all events. If this method is overridden, then the individual methods
       corresponding to each event name will not be automatically called (however,
       the subclass implementation can invoke these methods as it wishes.)
