class Callback(Serializable, abc.ABC):
    """Base class for callbacks.

    Callbacks provide hooks that can run at each training loop :class:`~composer.core.event.Event`.  A callback is
    similar to an :class:`~composer.core.algorithm.Algorithm` in that they are run on specific events. Callbacks differ
    from :class:`~composer.core.algorithm.Algorithm` in that they do not modify the training of the model.  By
    convention, callbacks should not modify the :class:`~composer.core.state.State`. They are typically used to for
    non-essential recording functions such as logging or timing. 

    Callbacks can be implemented in two ways:

    #. Override the individual methods named for each :class:`~composer.core.event.Event`.

       For example,
           >>> class MyCallback(Callback):
           ...     def epoch_start(self, state: State, logger: Logger):
           ...         print(f'Epoch {state.timer.epoch}')
           >>> # construct trainer object with your callback
           >>> trainer = Trainer(
           ...     model=model,
           ...     train_dataloader=train_dataloader,
           ...     eval_dataloader=eval_dataloader,
           ...     optimizers=optimizer,
           ...     max_duration="1ep",
           ...     callbacks=[MyCallback()],
           ... )
           >>> # trainer will run MyCallback whenever the EPOCH_START
           >>> # is triggered, like this:
           >>> _ = trainer.engine.run_event(Event.EPOCH_START)
           Epoch Time(0, TimeUnit.EPOCH)

    #. Override :meth:`run_event` if you want a single method to handle all events. 
       If this method is overridden, then the individual methods corresponding to each event name
       (such as :meth:`epoch_start`) will no longer be automatically invoked.


       For example,
           >>> class MyCallback(Callback):
           ...     def run_event(self, event: Event, state: State, logger: Logger):
           ...         if event == Event.EPOCH_START:
           ...             print(f'Epoch {state.epoch}/{state.max_epochs}')
           >>> # construct trainer object with your callback
           >>> trainer = Trainer(
           ...     model=model,
           ...     train_dataloader=train_dataloader,
           ...     eval_dataloader=eval_dataloader,
           ...     optimizers=optimizer,
           ...     max_duration="1ep",
           ...     callbacks=[MyCallback()],
           ... )
           >>> # trainer will run MyCallback whenever the EPOCH_START
           >>> # is triggered, like this:
           >>> _ = trainer.engine.run_event(Event.EPOCH_START)
           Epoch 0/1
