    """How and when DDP gradient synchronization should happen.

    Attributes:
        SINGLE_AUTO_SYNC: The default behavior for DDP. Gradients are synchronized as they
            computed, for only the final microbatch of a batch. This is the most efficient
            strategy, but can lead to errors when ``find_unused_parameters`` is set, since
            it is possible different microbatches may use different sets of parameters,
            leading to an incomplete sync.
        MULTI_AUTO_SYNC: The default behavior for DDP when ``find_unused_parameters`` is set.
            Gradients are synchronized as they are computed for all microbatches. This ensures
            complete synchronization, but is less efficient than :attr:`SINGLE_AUTO_SYNC`. This
            efficiency gap is usually small, as long as either DDP syncs are a small portion
            of the trainer's overall runtime, or the number of microbatches per batch is
            relatively small.
        FORCED_SYNC: Gradients are manually synchronized only after all gradients have been
            computed for the final microbatch of a batch. Like :attr:`MULTI_AUTO_SYNC`, this
            strategy ensures complete gradient synchronization, but this tends to be slower than
            :attr:`MULTI_AUTO_SYNC`. This is because ordinarily syncs can happen in parallel
            with the ``loss.backward()`` computation, meaning syncs can be mostly complete by
            the time that function finishes. However, in certain circumstances, syncs may take
            a very long time to complete - if there are also a lot of microbatches per batch,
            this strategy may be optimal.
