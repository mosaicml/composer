    Args:
        path_format (str): The path format string to an existing checkpoint file.

            It can be a path to a file on the local disk, a URL, or if ``object_store`` is set, the object name
            for a checkpoint in a cloud bucket.

            When using `Deepspeed ZeRO <https://www.deepspeed.ai/tutorials/zero/>`_, checkpoints are shareded by rank.
            Instead of hard-coding the rank in the ``path_format``, use the following format variables:

            +------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
            | Variable               | Description                                           |
            +========================+=======================================================+
            | ``{rank}``             | The global rank, as returned by                       |
            |                        | :func:`~.dist.get_global_rank`.                       |
            +------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
            | ``{local_rank}``       | The local rank of the process, as returned by         |

            For example, suppose that checkpoints are stored in the following structure:

            .. code-block::

                my_model/rank_0/ep1.tar
                my_model/rank_1/ep1.tar
                my_model/rank_2/ep1.tar
                ...

            Then, ``path_format`` should be set to ``my_model/rank_{rank}/ep1.tar``, and all ranks will load the
            correct state.

        state (State): The :class:`~composer.core.state.State` to load the checkpoint into.
        object_store (ObjectStoreProvider, optional): If the ``path_format`` is in an object store
            (i.e. AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage), an instance of
            :class:`~.ObjectStoreProvider` which will be used
            to retreive the checkpoint. Otherwise, if the checkpoint is a local filepath, set to ``None``.
            (default: ``None``)
        load_weights_only (bool, optional): Whether or not to only restore the model weights from the checkpoint without
            restoring the associated state. (default: ``False``)
        strict_model_weights (bool, optional): Whether or not to force that the checkpointed weights must exactly
            match the model weights. (default: ``False``)
        chunk_size (int, optional): Chunk size (in bytes) to use when downloading checkpoints.
            Ignored if the checkpoint is a local file path. (default: ``1_048_576`` bytes (1 MB))
        progress_bar (bool, optional): Whether or not to show a progress bar when downloading checkpoints.
            Ignored if the checkpoint is a local file path. (default: ``True``)

    Returns:
        Optional[List[types.StateDict]]: The RNG state dicts, indexed by global rank, if
            :attr:`load_weights_only` is not None. Otherwise, None.
