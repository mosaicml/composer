class CheckpointSaver(Callback):
    __doc__ = f"""Callback to save checkpoints.

    .. note::

        If the ``folder`` argument is specified when constructing the :class:`.Trainer`, then the :class:`.CheckpointSaver`
        callback need not be constructed manually. However, for advanced checkpointing use cases 
        (such as saving a weights-only checkpoint at one interval and the full training state
        at another interval), instance(s) of this :class:`.CheckpointSaver` callback can be specified in the
        ``callbacks`` argument of the :class:`.Trainer`, as shown in the example below.

    Example

    .. testsetup::

        from composer.callbacks.checkpoint_saver import CheckpointSaver

    .. doctest::

        >>> trainer = Trainer(..., callbacks=[
        ...     CheckpointSaver(
        ...         folder='{{run_name}}/checkpoints',
        ...         filename="ep{{epoch}}-ba{{batch}}-rank{{rank}}",
        ...         latest_filename="latest-rank{{rank}}",
        ...         save_interval="1ep",
        ...         weights_only=False,
        ...     )
        ... ])

    .. testcleanup::

        trainer.engine.close()

    Args:
        folder (str, optional): Format string for the folder where checkpoints will be saved.
            Default: ``'{{run_name}}/checkpoints'``.

            The following format variables are available:

            {textwrap.indent(FORMAT_NAME_WITH_DIST_TABLE, prefix='            ')}

            .. note::

                When training with multiple devices (i.e. GPUs), ensure that ``'{{rank}}'`` appears in the format.
                Otherwise, multiple processes may attempt to write to the same file.

        filename (str, optional): A format string describing how to name checkpoints.
            Default: ``'ep{{epoch}}-ba{{batch}}-rank{{rank}}'``.

            Checkpoints will be saved approximately to ``{{folder}}/{{filename.format(...)}}``.

            The following format variables are available:

            {textwrap.indent(FORMAT_NAME_WITH_DIST_AND_TIME_TABLE, prefix='            ')}


            .. note::

                *   By default, only the rank zero process will save a checkpoint file.

                *   When using DeepSpeed, each rank will save a checkpoint file in tarball format. DeepSpeed
                    requires tarball format, as it saves model and optimizer states in separate files.
                    Ensure that ``'{{rank}}'`` appears within the ``filename``. Otherwise, multiple ranks
                    may attempt to write to the same file(s), leading to corrupted checkpoints. If no tarball file
                    extension is specified, ``'.tar'`` will be used.

                *   To use compression (regardless of whether DeepSpeed is enabled), set the file extension
                    to ``'.tar.gz'``, ``'.tgz'``, ``'.tar.bzip'``, or ``'.tar.lzma'`` (depending on the desired
                    compression algorithm).

            .. warning::

                Using compression will block the training loop while checkpoints are being compressed. As such, we
                recommend saving checkpoints without compression.

            Consider the following scenario where:

            *   The :attr:`~.Logger.run_name` is ``'awesome-training-run'``
            *   The default ``folder='{{run_name}}/checkpoints'`` is used.
            *   The default ``name='ep{{epoch}}-ba{{batch}}-rank{{rank}}'`` is used.
            *   The current epoch count is ``1``.
            *   The current batch count is ``42``.

            When DeepSpeed is not being used, the rank zero process will save the checkpoint to 
            ``"awesome-training-run/checkpoints/ep1-ba42-rank0"``.

            When DeepSpeed is being used, each rank (process) will save checkpoints to::

                awesome-training-run/checkpoints/ep1-ba42-rank0.tar
                awesome-training-run/checkpoints/ep1-ba42-rank1.tar
                awesome-training-run/checkpoints/ep1-ba42-rank2.tar
                ...

        artifact_name (str, optional): Format string for the checkpoint's artifact name.
            Default: ``"{{run_name}}/checkpoints/ep{{epoch}}-ba{{batch}}-rank{{rank}}"``.

            After the checkpoint is saved, it will be periodically logged as a file artifact.
            The artifact name will be determined by this format string.

            .. seealso:: :meth:`.Logger.log_file_artifact` for file artifact logging.

            The same format variables for ``filename`` are available.

            Leading slashes (``'/'``) will be stripped.

            To disable logging trace files as file artifacts, set this parameter to ``None``.
        latest_filename (str, optional): A format string for a symlink which points to the last saved checkpoint.
            Default: ``'latest-rank{{rank}}'``.
            
            Symlinks will be created approximately at ``{{folder}}/{{latest_filename.format(...)}}``. 

            The same format variables as for ``name`` are available.

            To disable symlinks, set this parameter to ``None``.

            Consider the following scenario, where:

            *   The :attr:`~.Logger.run_name` is 'awesome-training-run'
            *   The default ``folder='{{run_name}}/checkpoints'`` is used.
            *   The default ``name='ep{{epoch}}-ba{{batch}}-rank{{rank}}'`` is used.
            *   The default ``latest_filename='latest-rank{{rank}}'`` is used.
            *   The current epoch count is ``1``.
            *   The current batch count is ``42``.

            When DeepSpeed is not being used, the rank zero process will save the checkpoint to
            ``'awesome-training-run/checkpoints/ep1-ba42-rank0'``,
            and a symlink will be created at
            ``'awesome-training-run/checkpoints/latest-rank0' -> 'awesome-training-run/checkpoints/ep1-ba42-rank0'``

            When DeepSpeed is being used, each rank (process) will save checkpoints to::

                awesome-training-run/checkpoints/ep1-ba42-rank0.tar
                awesome-training-run/checkpoints/ep1-ba42-rank1.tar
                awesome-training-run/checkpoints/ep1-ba42-rank2.tar
                ...

            Corresponding symlinks will be created at::

                awesome-training-run/checkpoints/latest-rank0.tar -> awesome-training-run/checkpoints/ep1-ba42-rank0.tar
                awesome-training-run/checkpoints/latest-rank1.tar -> awesome-training-run/checkpoints/ep1-ba42-rank1.tar
                awesome-training-run/checkpoints/latest-rank2.tar -> awesome-training-run/checkpoints/ep1-ba42-rank2.tar
                ...
        latest_artifact_name (str, optional): Format string for the checkpoint's latest symlink artifact name.
            Default: ``'{{run_name}}/checkpoints/latest-rank{{rank}}"``.

            Whenever a new checkpoint is saved, a symlink artifact is created or updated to point to the latest checkpoint's ``artifact_name``.
            The artifact name will be determined by this format string. This parameter has no effect if ``latest_filename`` or ``artifact_name`` is ``None``.

            .. seealso:: :meth:`.Logger.log_symlink_artifact` for symlink artifact logging.

            The same format variables for ``filename`` are available.

            Leading slashes (``'/'``) will be stripped.

            To disable symlinks in logger, set this parameter to ``None``.

        overwrite (bool, optional): Whether existing checkpoints should be overridden.
            If ``False`` (the default), then the ``folder`` must not exist or must not contain checkpoints which may conflict
            with the current run. Default: ``False``.

        save_interval (:class:`.Time` | str | int | (:class:`.State`, :class:`.Event`) -> bool): A :class:`.Time`, time-string, integer (in epochs),
            or a function that takes (state, event) and returns a boolean whether a checkpoint should be saved.

            If an integer, checkpoints will be saved every n epochs.
            If :class:`.Time` or a time-string, checkpoints will be saved according to this interval.

            .. seealso:: :func:`.checkpoint_periodically`

            If a function, then this function should take two arguments (:class:`.State`, :class:`.Event`).
            The first argument will be the current state of the trainer, and the second argument will be
            be :attr:`.Event.BATCH_CHECKPOINT` or :attr:`.Event.EPOCH_CHECKPOINT` (depending on the current training
            progress). It should return ``True`` if a checkpoint should be saved given the current state and
            event.

        weights_only (bool): If ``True``, save only the model weights instead of the entire training state.
            This parmeter must be ``False`` when using DeepSpeed. Default: ``False``.


        num_checkpoints_to_keep (int, optional): The number of checkpoints to keep locally. The oldest checkpoints
            are removed first. Set to ``-1`` to keep all checkpoints locally. Default: ``-1``.

            Checkpoints will be removed after they have been logged as a file artifact. For example, when this callback
            is used in conjunction with the :class:`.ObjectStoreLogger`, set this
            parameter to ``0`` to immediately delete checkpoints from the local disk after they have been uploaded to
            the object store.

            This parameter only controls how many checkpoints are kept locally; checkpoints are not deleted from
            artifact stores.

    Attributes:
        saved_checkpoints (List[Tuple[Timestamp, List[pathlib.Path]]]): The checkpoint timestamps and filepaths.

            This list contains tuples of the save timestamp and the checkpoint filepaths.
            This list will have at most ``num_checkpoints_to_keep`` entries. The latest checkpoint
            will be at the end.

            .. note::

                When using DeepSpeed, the index of a filepath in each list corresponds to the global rank of
                the process that wrote that file. Each filepath is valid only on the process's (rank's) node.

                Otherwise, when not using DeepSpeed, each sub-list will contain only one filepath since only rank zero
                saves checkpoints.
