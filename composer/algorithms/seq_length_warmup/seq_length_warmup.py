    """Set the sequence length of a batch.

    Changes the sequence length of all tensors in the provided dictionary
    to ``curr_seq_len`` by either truncating the tensors (``truncate=True``)
    or reshaping the tensors to create new examples from the extra tokens
    (``truncate=False``).

    .. note::

        The schedule for ``curr_seq_len`` over training time should be managed
        outside of this function.

    .. note::

        Variable input lengths can create CUDA OOM errors. To avoid this,
        we follow the `PyTorch notes <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes/tuning_guide.html#pre-allocate-memory-in-case-of-variable-input-length>`_
        and pre-allocate the memory with a blank forward and backward pass.

    Args:
        batch (Dict[str, Tensor]): The input batch to the model, must be a dictionary.
        curr_seq_length (int): The desired sequence length to apply.
        truncate (bool, optional): Truncate sequences early, or reshape tensors to create
            new examples out of the extra tokens. Default: ``True``.
        preserve_end_of_sequence (bool, optional): Preserve the end-of-sequence of the batch when
            truncating. Useful when input formats include a unique end-of-sequence token.
            Ignored if ``truncate=False``. Default: ``False``.
            E.g., if ``batch["input_ids"]`` is ``[[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]]``
            and ``curr_seq_length=3``, ``"input_ids"`` in the returned batch would be
            ``[[10, 11, 12]]`` with ``preserve_end_of_sequence=False`` and would be
            ``[[10, 11, 15]]`` with ``preserve_end_of_sequence=True``. This behavior applies to any
            batch tensor with 2 or more dimensions.

    Returns:
        Dict[str, Tensor]: a Mapping of input tensors to the model,
            where all tensors have curr_seq_len in the second dimension.

    """Progressively increases the sequence length during training.

    Changes the sequence length of all tensors in the input batch. The
    sequence length increases from ``min_seq_length`` to ``max_seq_length``
    in steps of ``step_size`` during the first ``duration`` fraction of
    training.

    The sequence length is then kept at ``max_seq_length``
    for the rest of training.

    Tensors are either truncated (``truncate=True``) or reshaped to
    create new examples from the extra tokens (``truncate=False``).

    This algorithm runs on :attr:`.Event.AFTER_DATALOADER` to modify
    the sequence length of a batch of data after the model and data have been moved to
    accelerators.

        ``step_size`` should be a `multiple of eight <https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/optimizing-gpu-performance-tensor-cores/>`_ for
