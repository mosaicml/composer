    The algorithm replaces the specified target layer with a stochastic version
    of the layer. The stochastic layer will randomly drop either samples or the

    `Tensorflow/TPU repo <https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu>`_.

    .. note::

        Stochastic Depth only works on instances of `torchvision.models.resnet.ResNet` for now.

    Args:
        model (torch.nn.Module): model containing modules to be replaced with stochastic versions
        target_layer_name (str): Block to replace with a stochastic block
            equivalent. The name must be registered in ``STOCHASTIC_LAYER_MAPPING``
            dictionary with the target layer class and the stochastic layer class.
            Currently, only :class:`torchvision.models.resnet.Bottleneck` is supported.
        stochastic_method (str, optional): The version of stochastic depth to use. ``"block"``
            randomly drops blocks during training. ``"sample"`` randomly drops
            samples within a block during training.
        drop_rate (float, optional): The base probability of dropping a layer or sample. Must be
            between 0.0 and 1.0.
        drop_distribution (str, optional): How ``drop_rate`` is distributed across
            layers. Value must be one of ``"uniform"`` or ``"linear"``.
            ``"uniform"`` assigns the same ``drop_rate`` across all layers.
            ``"linear"`` linearly increases the drop rate across layer depth
            starting with 0 drop rate and ending with ``drop_rate``.
        use_same_gpu_seed (bool, optional): Set to ``True`` to have the same layers dropped
            across GPUs when using multi-GPU training. Set to ``False`` to
            have each GPU drop a different set of layers. Only used
            with ``"block"`` stochastic method.
        optimizers (Optimizers, optional):  Existing optimizers bound to ``model.parameters()``.
            All optimizers that have already been constructed with
            ``model.parameters()`` must be specified here so they will optimize
            the correct parameters.

            If the optimizer(s) are constructed *after* calling this function,
            then it is safe to omit this parameter. These optimizers will see the correct
            model parameters.
