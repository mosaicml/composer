    """Create new samples using combinations of pairs of samples.

    This is done by masking a region of each image in ``input`` and filling
    the masked region with the corresponding content from a random different
    image in``input``.

    The position of the masked region is determined by drawing a center point
    uniformly at random from all spatial positions.

    The area of the masked region is computed using either ``length`` or
    ``alpha``. If ``length`` is provided, it directly determines the size
    of the masked region. If it is not provided, the fraction of the input
    area to mask is drawn from a ``Beta(alpha, alpha)`` distribution.
    The original paper uses a fixed value of ``alpha = 1``.

    Alternatively, one may provide a bounding box to mask directly, in
    which case ``alpha`` is ignored and ``length`` must not be provided.

    The same masked region is used for the whole batch.

    .. note::
        The masked region is clipped at the spatial boundaries of the inputs.
        This means that there is no padding required, but the actual region
        used may be smaller than the nominal size computed using ``length``
        or ``alpha``.

    Args:
        input (:class:`torch.Tensor`): input tensor of shape ``(N, C, H, W)``
        target (:class:`torch.Tensor`): target tensor of either shape ``N`` or
            ``(N, num_classes)``. In the former case, elements of ``target``
            must be integer class ids in the range ``0..num_classes``. In the
            latter case, rows of ``target`` may be arbitrary vectors of targets,
            including, e.g., one-hot encoded class labels, smoothed class
            labels, or multi-output regression targets.
        num_classes (int): total number of classes or output variables
        length (float, optional): Relative side length of the masked region.
            If specified, ``length`` is interpreted as a fraction of ``H`` and
            ``W``, and the resulting box is of size ``(length * H, length * W)``.
            Default: ``None``.
        alpha (float, optional): parameter for the Beta distribution over
            the fraction of the input to mask. Ignored if ``length`` is
            provided. Default: ``1``.
        bbox (tuple, optional): predetermined ``(x1, y1, x2, y2)``
            coordinates of the bounding box. Default: ``None``.
        indices (torch.Tensor, optional): Permutation of the samples to use.
            Default: ``None``.
        uniform_sampling (bool, optional): If ``True``, sample the bounding box
            such that each pixel has an equal probability of being mixed.
            If ``False``, defaults to the sampling used in the original paper
            implementation. Default: ``False``.

    Returns:
        input_mixed (torch.Tensor): batch of inputs after cutmix has been
            applied.
        target_mixed (torch.Tensor): soft labels for mixed input samples.
            These are a convex combination of the (possibly one-hot-encoded)
            labels from the original samples and the samples chosen to fill
            the masked regions, with the relative weighting equal to the
            fraction of the spatial size that is cut.
            E.g., if a sample was originally an image with label ``0`` and
            40% of the image of was replaced with data from an image with label
            ``2``, the resulting labels, assuming only three classes, would be
            ``[1, 0, 0] * 0.6 + [0, 0, 1] * 0.4 = [0.6, 0, 0.4]``.

class CutMix(Algorithm):
    """`CutMix <https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04899>`_ trains the network on non-overlapping combinations of pairs of
    examples and interpolated targets rather than individual examples and targets.

    This is done by taking a non-overlapping combination of a given batch X with a
    randomly permuted copy of X. The area is drawn from a ``Beta(alpha, alpha)``
    distribution.

    Training in this fashion sometimes reduces generalization error.

            in each pair tend to be weighted more equally. As ``alpha``
