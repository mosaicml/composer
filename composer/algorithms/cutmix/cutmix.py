    """Create new samples using combinations of pairs of samples.

    This is done by masking a region of ``X`` and filling the masked region with
    the corresponding content in a permuted copy ``X``. The permutation takes
    place along the sample axis (dim 0), so that each output image has part
    of it replaced with content from another image.

    The area of the masked region is determined by ``cut_proportion``, which
    must be in :math:`(0, 1)` if provided. If not provided, ``cut_proportion``
    is drawn from a :math:`Beta(alpha, alpha)` distribution for some parameter
    ``alpha > 0``. The original paper used a fixed value of ``alpha = 1``.

    Note that the same ``cut_proportion`` and masked region are used for
    the whole batch.

    Args:
        X (torch.Tensor): input tensor of shape ``(N, C, H, W)``
        y (torch.Tensor): target tensor of either shape ``N`` or
            ``(N, num_classes)``. In the former case, elements of ``y`` must
            be integer class ids in the range ``0..num_classes``. In the
            latter case, rows of ``y`` may be arbitrary vectors of targets,
            including, e.g., one-hot encoded class labels, smoothed class
            labels, or multi-output regression targets.
        num_classes (int): total number of classes or output variables
        cut_proportion (float, optional): relative area of cutmix region
            compared to the original size. Must be in the interval
            :math:`(0, 1)`. If ``None``, value is drawn from a
            ``Beta(alpha, alpha)`` distribution.
        alpha (float, optional): parameter for the Beta distribution over
            ``cut_proportion``. Ignored if ``cut_proportion`` is provided.
        bbox (Tuple, optional): predetermined ``(rx1, ry1, rx2, ry2)``
            coordinates of the bounding box.
        indices (torch.Tensor, optional): Permutation of the samples to use.

    Returns:
        X_mixed: batch of inputs after cutmix has been applied.
        y_mixed: soft labels for mixed input samples. These are a convex
            combination of the (possibly one-hot-encoded) labels from the
            original samples and the samples chosen to fill the masked
            regions, with the relative weighting equal to ``cut_proportion``.
            E.g., if a sample was originally an image with label ``0`` and
            40% of the image of was replaced with data from an image with label
            ``2``, the resulting labels, assuming only three classes, would be
            ``[1, 0, 0] * 0.6 + [0, 0, 1] * 0.4 = [0.6, 0, 0.4]``.

    """`CutMix <https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04899>`_ trains the network on non-overlapping combinations of pairs of
    examples and iterpolated targets rather than individual examples and targets.

    This is done by taking a non-overlapping combination of a given batch X with a
    randomly permuted copy of X. The area is drawn from a :math:`Beta(\alpha, \alpha)`
    distribution.

    Training in this fashion sometimes reduces generalization error.

    Args:
        num_classes (int): the number of classes in the task labels.
        alpha (float): the psuedocount for the Beta distribution used to sample
            area parameters. As ``alpha`` grows, the two samples
            in each pair tend to be weighted more equally. As ``alpha``
            approaches 0 from above, the combination approaches only using
            one element of the pair.
