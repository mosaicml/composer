    Training for less time is a strong baseline approach to speeding up
    training, provided that the training still gets through the entire
    learning rate schedule. E.g., training for half as long often yields
    little accuracy degredation, provided that the learning rate schedule
    is rescaled to take half as long as well. In contrast, if the schedule
    is not rescaled, training for half as long would mean simply stopping
    halfway through the training curve, which does reach nearly as
    high an accuracy.

    To see the difference, consider training for half as long using a cosine
    annealing learning rate schedule. If the schedule is not rescaled,
    training ends while the learning rate is still ~0.5. If the schedule is
    rescaled, training ends after passing through the full cosine
    curve, at a learning rate orders of .01 or smaller.
