    """Shrink targets towards a uniform distribution as in `Szegedy et al <https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567>`_.

    The smoothed labels are computed as ``(1 - smoothing) * targets + smoothing * unif``
    where ``unif`` is a vector with elements all equal to ``1 / num_classes``.

    Args:
        logits (torch.Tensor): predicted value for ``target``, or any other tensor
            with the same shape. Shape must be ``(N, num_classes, ...)`` for
            ``N`` examples and ``num_classes`` classes, with any number of
            optional extra dimensions.
        target (torch.Tensor): target tensor of either shape ``N`` or
            ``(N, num_classes, ...)``. In the former case, elements of
            ``targets`` must be integer class ids in the range
            ``0..num_classes``. In the latter case, ``targets`` must have the
            same shape as ``logits``.
        smoothing (float, optional): strength of the label smoothing, in
            :math:`[0, 1]`. ``smoothing=0`` means no label smoothing, and
            ``smoothing=1`` means maximal smoothing (targets are ignored).
            Default: ``0.1``.

    Returns:
        targets_smooth (torch.Tensor): The smoothed targets

    Example:
        .. testcode::

            import torch

            num_classes = 10
