    """Apply Stochastic Weight Averaging (`Izmailov et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05407>`_)

    Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) averages model weights sampled at
    different times near the end of training. This leads to better
    generalization than just using the final trained weights.

    Because this algorithm needs to maintain both the current value of the
    weights and the average of all of the sampled weights, it doubles the
    model's memory consumption. Note that this does not mean that the total
    memory required doubles, however, since stored activations and the
    optimizer state are not doubled.

    Args:
        swa_start: fraction of training completed before stochastic weight averaging is applied
        swa_lr: the final learning rate used for weight averaging

    Note that 'anneal_epochs' is not used in the current implementation
