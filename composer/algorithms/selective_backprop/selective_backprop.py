    a training run, once the model has already "learned" easy examples.

    To preserve convergence, SB can be interrupted with vanilla minibatch
    gradient steps every ``interrupt`` steps. When ``interrupt=0``, SB will be
    used at every step during the SB interval. When ``interrupt=2``, SB will
    alternate with vanilla minibatch steps.
