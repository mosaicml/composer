 `Computer Vision`

Gyro Dropout replaces implementations of `torch.nn.Dropout`. The Gyro Dropout provides increased accuracy compared with dropout.

Gyro dropout is a variant of dropout that improves the efficiency of training neural networks.
Instead of randomly dropping out neurons in every training iteration, gyro dropout pre-selects and trains a fixed
number of subnetworks. 'Sigma' is the number of total pre-selected subnetworks and 'Tau' is the number of concurrently scheduled subnetworks in an iteration.

## How to Use

### Functional Interface

```python
# Apply surgery on the model to swap-in the Gyro Dropout using the Composer functional API

import composer.functional as cf

def training_loop(model, train_loader):
    cf.apply_gyro_dropout(
        model,
        iters_per_epoch = 196,
        max_epoch = 100,
        p = 0.5,
        sigma = 256,
        tau = 16,
    )

    opt = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())
    loss_fn = F.cross_entropy
    model.train()

    for X, y in train_loader:
        y_hat = model(X)
        loss = loss_fn(y_hat, y)
        loss.backward()
        opt.step()
        opt.zero_grad()
```

                                          tau=16)])

trainer.fit()
```

### Implementation Details

Gyro Dropout is implemented by performing model surgery, which looks for instances of `torch.nn.Dropout`. This should be applicable to any model that utilizes `torch.nn.Dropout`.

## Suggested Hyperparameters

Gyro Dropout has two hyperparameters - sigma, tau. (iters_per_epoch and max_epoch is training-dependent)

For the hyperparameters (sigma, tau), we recommend (256, 16) in AlexNet, LeNet or (1024, 8) in ResNet-18, BERT.


## Technical Details
GyroDropout achieves improved accuracy over conventional dropout by pre-selecting a fixed number of subnetworks and training with only those subnetworks. Because the selected subnetworks are trained more robustly (compared to the conventional dropout), their diversity increases and thus their ensemble achieves higher accuracy.
