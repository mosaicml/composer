 `Natural Language Processing`, `Math Equivalent`

Low Precision LayerNorm forces `torch.nn.LayerNorm` modules to run in float16 or bfloat16 precision, improving utilization. This should not affect final convergence values, but in rare cases may cause loss spikes. This algorithm is an alternative to Fused LayerNorm, and should give very similar performance.


## How to Use
Low Precision LayerNorm wraps `torch.nn.LayerNorm`, forcing the module to run in a lower precision if you have autocast enabled. If you are running in Automatic Mixed Precision (`amp`) mode, Low Precision LayerNorm will run in `torch.float16`. If you are running in `bf16` mode, Low Precision LayerNorm will run in `torch.bfloat16`.

This algorithm will have no effect if you are running in `fp32` or `fp16` mode.


### Functional Interface

```python
# Apply surgery on the model to swap-in the Low Precision LayerNorm using the Composer functional API

import composer.functional as cf

def training_loop(model, train_loader):
    cf.apply_low_precision_layernorm(model, precision='amp')

    opt = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())
    loss_fn = F.cross_entropy
    model.train()

    for X, y in train_loader:
        y_hat = model(X)
        loss = loss_fn(y_hat, y)
        loss.backward()
        opt.step()
        opt.zero_grad()
```

### Composer Trainer

<!--pytest.mark.gpu-->
<!--
```python
from composer.devices import DeviceGPU
from tests.fixtures.synthetic_hf_state import make_dataset_configs, synthetic_hf_state_maker_with_device

synthetic_config = make_dataset_configs(model_family=['bert'])[0]
_, model, train_dataloader = synthetic_hf_state_maker_with_device(synthetic_config, DeviceGPU())
_, _, eval_dataloader = synthetic_hf_state_maker_with_device(synthetic_config, DeviceGPU())
```
-->
<!--pytest-codeblocks:cont-->
```python
from composer.trainer import Trainer
from composer.algorithms import LowPrecisionLayerNorm

trainer = Trainer(model=model,
                  train_dataloader=train_dataloader,
                  eval_dataloader=eval_dataloader,
                  max_duration='1ep',
                  algorithms=[LowPrecisionLayerNorm()])

trainer.fit()
```

### Implementation Details

Low Precision LayerNorm is implemented by performing model surgery, which looks for instances of `torch.nn.LayerNorm` and replaces them with `composer.algorithms.low_precision_layernorm.low_precision_layernorm.LPLayerNorm`, which is a thin wrapper around `torch.nn.LayerNorm` that manually turns autocast off and specifices the input dtype to lower precision. In `bf16` mode on PyTorch versions prior to 1.13, Low Precision LayerNorm will fall back to Fused LayerNorm, replacing instances of `torch.nn.LayerNorm` with `apex.normalization.fused_layer_norm`.

## Suggested Hyperparameters

Low Precision LayerNorm utilizes the existing `normalized_shape` and `d_eps` from the original model. The functional version of Low Precision LayerNorm allows users to specify the `precision` mode, which should be set to the Composer precision format of your model. When using the algorithm through the Composer trainer, Low Precision LayerNorm will use the trainer's `precision` mode.

## Technical Details

Low Precision LayerNorm is meant to replace our Fused LayerNorm algorithm. The two algorithms achieve very similar throughput. Fused LayerNorm also runs in low precision, but it is a more complex algorithm, since it uses a custom kernel. Since the custom kernel provides no additional speedup, we have replaced it with this simpler algorithm.
