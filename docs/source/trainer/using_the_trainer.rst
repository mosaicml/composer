|:gear:| Using the Trainer
==========================

.. _using_composer_trainer:

The Composer :class:`.Trainer` implements a highly-optimized PyTorch training loop for neural networks. Using the trainer gives you several superpowers:

-  Easily insert our library of efficiency methods into the
   trainer loop and compose them to train better models faster.
-  Strong optimized baseline implementations to kick off your deep
   learning work, with reproducible results in time-to-train and
   accuracy.
-  Integration with your favorite model hubs:
   ðŸ¤— `Transformers`_, `TIMM`_, and `torchvision`_.
-  Iterate faster! We take care of performance and efficiency.

.. note::

    We use the two-way callback system developed by (`Howard et al,
    2020 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04688>`__) to flexibly add the logic of
    our speedup methods during training.


Below are simple examples for getting started with the Composer Trainer
along with code snippets for more advanced usage such as using speedup
methods, checkpointing, and distributed training.

Getting Started
---------------

Create a model class that meets the :class:`.ComposerModel` interface,
minimally implementing the following methods:

-  ``def forward(batch) -> outputs`` : computes the forward pass based
   on the ``batch`` returned from the dataloader.
-  ``def loss(batch, outputs)``: returns the loss based on the
   ``outputs`` from the forward pass and the dataloader.

For more information, see the :doc:`ComposerModel</composer_model>` guide.

A minimal example of a ResNet-18 model is shown here:

.. testcode::

    import torchvision
    import torch.nn.functional as F

    from composer.models import ComposerModel

    class ResNet18(ComposerModel):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            self.model = torchvision.models.resnet18()

        def forward(self, batch):
            inputs, _ = batch
            return self.model(inputs)

        def loss(self, outputs, batch):
            _, targets = batch
            return F.cross_entropy(outputs, targets)

Then, the model can be passed to the trainer with the relevant torch
objects.

.. code:: python

    import torch

    trainer = Trainer(
        model=ResNet18(),
        train_dataloader=train_dataloader,
        eval_dataloader=eval_dataloader,
        optimizers=torch.optim.Adam(lr=0.01),
        max_duration=10,  # epochs
        device='gpu'
    )

    trainer.fit()

In the background, we automatically add the :class:`.ProgressBarLogger` to log
training progress to the console.


A few tips and tricks for using our Trainer:

-  For time-related inputs, such as the ``max_duration`` above, we
   support either an integer (which we assume is epochs) or a string. The
   string can have a suffix of ``"ep"`` (epochs), ``"ba"`` (batches), or
   ``"dur"`` (full training duration), among other options.
   For example, ``"10ba"`` means 10 minibatches (or steps) and ``"10ep"``
   means 10 epochs. See: :class:`.Time` for details.
-  If you are using gradient accumulation, the ``batch_size`` in your
   dataloaders should be the per-device macrobatch size, i.e. the batch size of your
   optimization update. For example, with ``grad_accum=2`` and
   ``batch_size=2048``, the trainer runs through two microbatches of size 1024
   each, then performs a gradient update step.
-  At any time, most of the relevant quantities for debugging are
   centralized into one variable: :class:`.State`.
-  We have an abstraction for tracking :class:`.Time`, see the
   :doc:`Time<time>` guide.
-  By default, the Trainer will pick a run name for you, but if you want to name your run,
   you can using the optional ``run_name`` argument to :class:`.Trainer`. See :doc:`/notes/run_name`
   for more information.

For a full list of Trainer options, see :class:`.Trainer`. Below, we
illustrate some example use cases.

Training Loop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Behind the scenes, our trainer handles much of the engineering for
distributed training, gradient accumulation, device movement, gradient
scaling, and others. The *pseudocode* for our trainer loop as it
interacts with the :class:`.ComposerModel` is as follows:

.. code:: python

    # training loop
    for batch in train_dataloader:

        outputs = model.forward(batch)
        loss = model.loss(outputs, batch)

        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    # eval loop
    for batch in eval_dataloader:
        outputs, targets = model.validate(batch)
        metrics.update(outputs, target)

For the actual code, see the :meth:`.Trainer.fit` and :meth:`.Trainer.eval` methods.

Quick Tour
----------

Below is a quick tour of various elements with code snippets for your reference. See the more
detailed sections in the navigation menu.

Events & State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The core principle of the Composer trainer is to make it easy to inject
custom logic to run at various points in the training loop. To do this,
we have events that run before and after each of the lines above, e.g.

.. code:: python

    engine.run_event("before_forward")
    outputs = model.forward(batch)
    engine.run_event("after_forward")

Algorithms and callbacks (see below) register themselves to run on one
or more events.

We also maintain a :class:`.State` which stores the trainer's state, such as
the model, optimizers, dataloader, current batch, etc. (see
:class:`.State`). This allows algorithms to modify the state during the
various events above.

.. seealso::

    :doc:`events` and :class:`.State`

Algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~

The Composer trainer is designed to easily apply our library of
algorithms to both train more efficiently and build better models. These
can be enabled by passing the appropriate algorithm class to the ``algorithms``
argument.

.. testcode::

    from composer import Trainer
    from composer.algorithms import LayerFreezing, MixUp

    trainer = Trainer(
        model=model,
        train_dataloader=train_dataloader,
        eval_dataloader=eval_dataloader,
        max_duration='2ep',
        algorithms=[
            LayerFreezing(freeze_start=0.5, freeze_level=0.1),
            MixUp(alpha=0.1),
        ])

    # the algorithms will automatically be applied during the appropriate
    # points of the training loop
    trainer.fit()

We handle inserting algorithms into the training loop and in the right order.

.. seealso::

    Our :doc:`algorithms` guide and the individual
    :doc:`/method_cards/methods_overview` for each algorithm.


Optimizers & Schedulers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can easily specify which optimizer and learning rate scheduler to
use during training. Composer supports both PyTorch schedulers as
well as Composer's custom schedulers.

.. testcode::

    from composer import Trainer
    from composer.models import composer_resnet
    from torch.optim import SGD
    from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import LinearLR

    model = composer_resnet(model_name="resnet50", num_classes=1000)
    optimizer = SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.1)
    scheduler = LinearLR(optimizer)

    trainer = Trainer(
        model=model,
        train_dataloader=train_dataloader,
        eval_dataloader=eval_dataloader,
        max_duration='90ep',
        optimizers=optimizer,
        schedulers=scheduler
    )

Composer's own custom schedulers are versions that support the
:class:`.Time` abstraction. Time related inputs such as ``step``
or ``T_max`` can be provided in many units, from epochs (``"10ep"``)
to batches (``"2048ba"``) to duration (``"0.7dur"``).

For example, the below would step the learning rate at 30%, 50%, and
90% of the way through the training process:


.. testcode::

    from composer import Trainer
    from composer.optim.scheduler import MultiStepScheduler

    trainer = Trainer(
        model=model,
        train_dataloader=train_dataloader,
        max_duration='90ep',
        schedulers=MultiStepScheduler(
            milestones=['0.3dur', '0.5dur', '0.9dur'],
            gamma=0.1
    ))


See :doc:`schedulers` for details.


Training on GPU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Control which device you use for training with the ``device`` parameter,
and we will handle the data movement and other systems-related
engineering. We currently support the ``cpu`` and ``gpu`` devices.

.. testcode::

    from composer import Trainer

    trainer = Trainer(
        model=model,
        train_dataloader=train_dataloader,
        eval_dataloader=eval_dataloader,
        max_duration='2ep',
        device='cpu'
    )

Distributed Training
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's also simple to do data-parallel training on multiple GPUs. Composer
provides a launcher command that works with the trainer and handles all
the ``torch.distributed`` setup for you.

.. code:: python

    # run_trainer.py

    from composer import Trainer

    trainer = Trainer(
        model=model,
        train_dataloader=train_dataloader,
        eval_dataloader=eval_dataloader,
        max_duration='160ep',
        device='gpu'
    )
    trainer.fit()

Access the Composer launcher via the ``composer`` command line program.
Specify the number of GPUs you'd like to use  with the ``-n`` flag
along with the file containing your training script.
Use ``composer --help`` to see a full list of configurable options.

.. code:: bash

    # run training on 8 GPUs
    $ composer -n 8 run_trainer.py

For multiple GPUs, the ``batch_size`` for each dataloader should be the
per-device batch size. For example, to use a total batch size of 2048 with
data parallel across 8 GPUs the dataloader should set ``batch_size=256``.


.. warning::

    For distributed training, your dataloader should use the
    :mod:`torch.utils.data.distributed.DistributedSampler`. If you
    are running multi-node, and each rank does not have a copy of the
    dataset, then a normal sampler can be used.


.. seealso::

    Our :doc:`/notes/distributed_training` guide and
    the :mod:`composer.utils.dist` module.


DeepSpeed Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Composer comes with DeepSpeed support, allowing you to leverage their
full set of features that makes it easier to train large models across
(1) any type of GPU and (2) multiple nodes. For more details on DeepSpeed,
see `their website <https://www.deepspeed.ai>`__.

To enable DeepSpeed, simply pass in a config as specified in the
DeepSpeed docs `here <https://www.deepspeed.ai/docs/config-json/>`__.

.. code:: python

    # run_trainer.py

    from composer import Trainer

    trainer = Trainer(
        model=model,
        train_dataloader=train_dataloader,
        eval_dataloader=eval_dataloader,
        max_duration='160ep',
        device='gpu',
        deepspeed_config={
            "train_batch_size": 2048,
            "fp16": {"enabled": True},
    })

Providing an empty dictionary to DeepSpeed is also valid. The DeepSpeed
defaults will be used and other fields (such as precision) will be inferred
from the trainer.

.. warning::

    The ``deepspeed_config`` must not conflict with any other parameters
    passed to the trainer.


Callbacks
~~~~~~~~~

You can insert arbitrary callbacks to be run at various points during
the training loop. The Composer library provides several useful
callbacks for things such as monitoring throughput and memory usage
during training, but you can also implement your own.

.. code:: python

    from composer import Trainer
    from composer.callbacks import SpeedMonitor

    # include a callback for tracking throughput/step during training
    trainer = Trainer(
        model=model,
        train_dataloader=train_dataloader,
        eval_dataloader=eval_dataloader,
        max_duration='160ep',
        device='gpu',
        callbacks=[SpeedMonitor(window_size=100)]
    )

.. seealso::

    The :doc:`callbacks` guide and :mod:`composer.callbacks`.


Numerics
~~~~~~~~

The trainer automatically handles multiple precision types such as ``fp32`` or, for GPUs,
``amp`` (automatic mixed precision), which is PyTorch's built-in method for training
in 16-bit floating point. For more details on ``amp``, see :mod:`torch.cuda.amp` and
the paper by `Micikevicius et al, 2018 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03740>`__

We recommend using ``amp`` on GPUs to accelerate your training.

.. code:: python

    from composer import Trainer

    # use mixed precision during training
    trainer = Trainer(
        model=model,
        train_dataloader=train_dataloader,
        eval_dataloader=eval_dataloader,
        max_duration='160ep',
        device='gpu',
        precision='amp'
    )

.. seealso::

    Our :doc:`/notes/numerics` guide.

Checkpointing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Composer trainer makes it easy to (1) save checkpoints at various
points during training and (2) load them back to resume training later.

.. code:: python

    from composer import Trainer

    ### Saving checkpoints
    trainer = Trainer(
        model=model,
        train_dataloader=train_dataloader,
        eval_dataloader=eval_dataloader,
        max_duration='160ep',
        device='gpu',
        # Checkpointing params
        save_folder: 'checkpoints',
        save_interval: '1ep'
    )

    # will save checkpoints to the 'checkpoints' folder every epoch
    trainer.fit()

.. code:: python

    from composer import Trainer

    ### Loading checkpoints
    trainer = Trainer(
        model=model,
        train_dataloader=train_dataloader,
        eval_dataloader=eval_dataloader,
        max_duration='160ep',
        device='gpu',
        # Checkpointing params
        load_path='path/to/checkpoint/mosaic_states.pt'
    )

    # will load the trainer state (including model weights) from the
    # load_path before resuming training
    trainer.fit()

.. seealso::

    The :doc:`checkpointing` guide.

Gradient Accumulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Composer supports gradient accumulation, which allows training arbitrary
logical batch sizes on any hardware by breaking the batch into ``grad_accum``
different microbatches.

.. code:: python

    from composer import Trainer

    trainer = Trainer(
        ...,
        grad_accum=2,
    )

If ``grad_accum=auto``, Composer will try to automatically determine the
smallest ``grad_accum`` which the current hardware supports. In order to support automatic
gradient accumulation, Composer initially sets ``grad_accum=1``. During the training process,
if a Cuda Out of Memory Exception is encountered, indicating the current batch size is too
large for the hardware, Composer catches this exception and continues training after doubling
``grad_accum``. As a secondary benefit, automatic gradient accumulation is able to dynamically
adjust throughout the training process. For example, when using ``ProgressiveResizing``, input
size increases throughout training. Composer automatically increases ``grad_accum`` only when
required, such as when a Cuda OOM is encountered due to larger images, allowing for faster
training at the start until image sizes are scaled up. Note that this feature is experimental
and may not work with all algorithms.

Reproducibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The random seed can be provided to the trainer directly, e.g.

.. testcode::

    from composer import Trainer

    trainer = Trainer(
        ...,
        seed=42,
    )

If no seed is provided, a random seed will be generated from the system time.

Since the model and dataloaders are initialized outside of the Trainer, for complete
determinism we recommend calling :func:`~composer.utils.reproducibility.seed_all` and/or
:func:`~composer.utils.reproducibility.configure_deterministic_mode` before creating any objects. For example:

.. testsetup::

    import functools
    import torch.nn
    import warnings

    warnings.filterwarnings(action="ignore", message="Deterministic mode is activated.")

    MyModel = Model

.. testcode::

    import torch.nn as nn
    from composer.utils import reproducibility

    reproducibility.configure_deterministic_mode()
    reproducibility.seed_all(42)

    model = MyModel()

    def init_weights(m):
        if isinstance(m, torch.nn.Linear):
            nn.init.xavier_uniform(m.weight)

    # model will now be deterministically initialized, since the seed is set.
    init_weights(model)
    trainer = Trainer(model=model, seed=42)

Note that the Trainer must still be seeded.

This was just a quick tour of the features available within our trainer.
Please see the other guides and notebooks for further details.
