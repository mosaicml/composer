Composer
========

`Composer <https://github.com/mosaicml/composer>`_ is a library for training neural networks better, faster, and cheaper.
It contains many state-of-the-art methods for accelerating neural network training and improving generalization, along with
an optional :doc:`Trainer<trainer/using_the_trainer>` API that makes `composing` many different enhancements easy.

We implemented dozens of papers and `trained thousands of models <https://app.mosaicml.com/explorer/imagenet>`_ so you don't have to.

With Composer, you can build recipes to:

.. include:: ../../README.md
   :parser: myst_parser.sphinx_
   :start-after: <!-- start numbers -->
   :end-before: <!-- end numbers -->

.. include:: ../../README.md
   :parser: myst_parser.sphinx_
   :start-after: <!-- start main results -->
   :end-before: <!-- end main results -->


Composer features:

- 20+ curated efficiency methods for training better language and vision models.
- An easy-to-use Trainer interface written to be as performant as possible, with integrated multi-GPU training, mixed-precision training, and numerous `best practices <https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/5-best-practices-for-efficient-model-training>`_ implemented out of the box.
- Standalone functional forms of training methods for easy integration into your own training loop
- Strong, reproducible baselines to get you started as fast as possible.

See :doc:`getting_started/installation` for
how to install and start using Composer, :doc:`trainer/using_the_trainer` for an introduction
to our trainer, and :doc:`trainer/algorithms` for details about our efficiency methods and how to use them in your code.

At `MosaicML <https://mosaicml.com>`_, we are focused on making fast, high-quality ML training accessible to everyone. To do this,
we continually productionize state-of-the-art academic research on efficient model
training, and also study the `combinations` of these methods in order to ensure
that model training is ✨ as efficient as possible ✨.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us on `Twitter`_, `Email`_, or `Slack`_!

Composer is part of the broader Machine Learning community, and we welcome any contributions, pull requests, and issues.
