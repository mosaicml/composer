##################
Model Family Name
##################
.. The name of the model family.

Link to Code
=============

Uses
=====
.. The category of tasks, kind of tasks, and tasks associated with it

Attribution
============
.. Links to papers or code and names of those who created/contributed to the modern conception of the model.

Architecture
=============
.. A high-level overview of the model architecture, with links to appropriate references or diagrams as necessary.

Family Members
===============
.. The members of the model family, their specific details, their parameter counts, etc. in a table. The instance and the scaling function.

Standard Training Hyperparameters
==================================
.. The typical hyperparameters for training the model family on a given task.

Training Time
==============
.. The number of hours on standard hardware that is typically necessary to train the model using our code.

Standard Quality
=================
.. The quality of the resulting models. Ours in relation to definitive papers in the literature. Characterize with and without any additional tricks that we would consider "speedup methods."

Additional Considerations
==========================
.. Any additional considerations for how the members of the model family are defined or used.
