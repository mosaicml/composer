|:pickup_truck:| ComposerModel
==============================

Your Pytorch model and training step must be re-organized as a
:class:`.ComposerModel` in order to use our :class:`.Trainer`.
This interface helps our trainer access the necessary parts of your model
to easily speed up training.

Using your own Model
--------------------

To create a trainable torchvision ResNet-18 classifier with cross-entropy loss,
define the |forward| and |loss| methods.

Notice how the forward pass is still under user control (no magic here!)
and encapsulated together clearly within the architecture.

The trainer takes care of:

-  ``x.to(device), y.to(device)``
-  ``loss.backward()``
-  ``optimizer.zero_grad()``
-  ``optimizer.step()``

As well as other features such as distributed training, numerics,
and gradient accumulation.

.. code:: python

    import torchvision
    import torch.nn.functional as F

    from composer.models import ComposerModel

    class ResNet18(ComposerModel):

        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            self.model = torchvision.models.resnet18()

        def forward(self, batch): # batch is the output of the dataloader
            # specify how batches are passed through the model
            inputs, _ = batch
            return self.model(inputs)

        def loss(self, outputs, batch):
            # pass batches and `forward` outputs to the loss
            _, targets = batch
            return F.cross_entropy(outputs, targets)

The Composer model can then be passed to our trainer.

.. code:: python

    import torch.optim as optim
    from composer import Trainer

    model = ResNet18()
    optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.0001)
    train_dataloader # standard pytorch dataloader

    trainer = Trainer(
        model=model,
        optimizers=optimizer,
        train_dataloader=train_dataloader,
        max_duration='10ep'
    )
    trainer.fit()

Both the |forward| and |loss| methods are passed the ``batch`` directly
from the dataloader. We leave the unpacking of that batch into inputs and targets
to the user since it can vary depending on the task.

We also provide several common classes for various tasks, specifically:

-  :class:`.ComposerClassifier` - classification tasks with a cross entropy
   loss and accuracy metric.
-  :func:`.composer_timm` - creates classification models from the popular `TIMM`_
   library.
-  :class:`.HuggingFaceModel` - :class:`.ComposerModel` wrapper for a ðŸ¤— `Transformers`_ model.

.. note::

    Users from other frameworks such as pytorch lightning may be used to
    defining a ``training_step`` method which groups the forward and loss
    together. However, many of our algorithmic methods (such as
    label smoothing or selective backprop) need to intercept and modify the
    loss. For this reason, we split it into two separate methods.

By convention, we define our PyTorch layers in the ``self.model``
attribute of :class:`.ComposerModel`. We encourage this pattern because
it makes it easier to extract the underlying model for inference when training is
completed. However, this is not enforced, and users can configure the
layers directly in the class if they prefer.

Metrics
-------

To compute metrics during training, implement the following methods:

.. code:: python

   def validate (self, batch) -> outputs, targets:
       ...

   def metrics(self, train=False) -> Metrics:
       ...

where ``Metrics`` should be compatible with the ``torchmetrics`` package. We
require that the output of :meth:`.ComposerModel.validate` be consumable by
``torchmetrics``. Specifically, the validation loop does something like this:

.. code:: python

    metrics = model.metrics(train=False)

    for batch in val_dataloader:
        outputs, targets = model.validate(batch)
        metrics.update(outputs, targets)  # implements the torchmetrics interface

    metrics.compute()

A full example of a validation implementation would be:

.. code:: python

    class ComposerClassifier(ComposerModel):

        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            self.model = torchvision.models.resnet18()
            self.train_accuracy = torchmetrics.Accuracy()
            self.val_accuracy = torchmetrics.Accuracy()

        ...

        def validate(self, batch):
            inputs, targets = batch
            outputs = self.model(inputs)
            return outputs, targets

        def metrics(self, train=False):
            # defines which metrics to use in each phase of training
            return self.train_accuracy if train else self.val_accuracy

.. note::

    No need to set ``model.eval()`` or ``torch.no_grad()`` â€” we take care
    of that in our trainer. ``torchmetrics`` also handles metrics logging
    when using distributed training.


Logging Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The trainer automatically logs the results of the metrics and the loss
using all of the ``loggers`` specified by the user. For example, to log
the results to a ``dict``, use the :class:`.InMemoryLogger`.

.. seealso::

    Our guide to :doc:`Logging<trainer/logging>`.


Multiple Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run multiple metrics, wrap them in a :class:`torchmetrics.MetricCollection`.

.. code:: python

    from torchmetrics.collections import MetricCollection

    def metrics(self, train: bool = False) -> Metrics:
        if train:
            return MetricCollection([self.train_loss, self.train_accuracy])
        return MetricCollection([self.val_loss, self.val_accuracy])

.. note::

    We use all the metrics provided to the validation dataset. If
    you have multiple eval datasets and different metrics, we recommend
    using :class:`.Evaluator` (see :doc:`Evaluation<trainer/evaluation>`)

Integrations
------------



TIMM
~~~~

Integrate with your favorite `TIMM`_ models with our :func:`.composer_timm` class.

.. code:: python

    from composer.models import composer_timm

    timm_model = composer_timm(model_name='resnet50', pretrained=True)

BERT Example with ðŸ¤— Transformers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this example, we create a BERT model loaded from ðŸ¤— Transformers
and make it compatible with our trainer.

.. code:: python

    from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification
    from torchmetrics import Accuracy
    from torchmetrics.collections import MetricCollection

    from composer.models import HuggingFaceModel
    from composer.metrics import LanguageCrossEntropy

    # huggingface model
    model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
                            'bert-base-uncased',
                             num_labels=2)

    # list of torchmetrics
    metrics = [LanguageCrossEntropy(vocab_size=30522), Accuracy()]

    # composer model, ready to be passed to our trainer
    composer_model = HuggingFaceModel(model, metrics=metrics)
