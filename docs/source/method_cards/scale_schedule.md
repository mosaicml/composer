Scale Schedule changes the number of training steps by a dilation factor and dilating learning rate changes
accordingly. Doing so varies the training budget, making it possible to explore tradeoffs between cost (measured in
time or money) and the quality of the final model.

## How to Use

### Implementation Details

Scale schedule is implemented as part of the {class}`~.Trainer` via the `scale_schedule_ratio` argument.
The trainer will scale the ``max_duration`` by the ``scale_schedule_ratio``, and also adjust non-warmup milestones
for the learning rate schedulers.

Scale schedule supports all Composer Schedulers:

```{eval-rst}
.. currentmodule:: composer.optim.scheduler
.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:

    StepScheduler
    MultiStepScheduler
    MultiStepWithWarmupScheduler
    ConstantScheduler
    LinearScheduler
    LinearWithWarmupScheduler
    ExponentialScheduler
    CosineAnnealingScheduler
    CosineAnnealingWithWarmupScheduler
    CosineAnnealingWarmRestartsScheduler
    PolynomialScheduler
    PolynomialWithWarmupScheduler
```

```{eval-rst}
.. seealso:: The :ref:`Scheduling Guide <Composer Schedulers>` more information about Composer Schedulers.
```

Scale schedule also supports the following PyTorch Schedulers:
* {class}`~torch.optim.lr_scheduler.StepLR`
* {class}`~torch.optim.lr_scheduler.MultiStepLR`
* {class}`~torch.optim.lr_scheduler.ExponentialLR`
* {class}`~torch.optim.lr_scheduler.CosineAnnealingLR`
* {class}`~torch.optim.lr_scheduler.CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts`.


For example, the code below will scale the training time by half
(to 10 epochs) and also scale the learning rate schedule.

```{eval-rst}
.. testcode::

    from composer import Trainer
    from composer.optim.scheduler import MultiStepScheduler

    trainer = Trainer(
        ...,
        max_duration="20ep",
        schedulers=MultiStepScheduler(milestones=["10ep", "16ep"]),
        scale_schedule_ratio=0.5,
    )

    # or equivalently, with default SSR=1.0:

    trainer = Trainer(
        ...,
        max_duration="10ep",
        schedulers=MultiStepScheduler(milestones=["5ep", "8ep"])
    )
```

For additional details on using the scale schedule ratio, see the {ref}`Scale Schedule Ratio <Scale Schedule Ratio>`
section in the schedulers guide.

## Suggested Hyperparameters

The default scale schedule ratio is 1.0. For a standard maximum number of epochs (these will differ depending on the
task), scaling down the learning rate schedule will lead to a monotonic decrease in accuracy. Increasing the scale
schedule ratio will often improve the accuracy up to a plateau, although this leads to longer training time and added
cost.

## Techical Details

Changing the length of training will affect the final accuracy of the model. For example, training ResNet-50 on
ImageNet for the standard schedule in the `composer` library leads to final validation accuracy of 76.6%, while
using scale schedule with a ratio of 0.5 leads to final validation accuracy of 75.6%. Training for longer can lead
to diminishing returns or even overfitting and worse validation accuracy. In general, the cost of training is
proportional to the length of training when using scale schedule (assuming all other techniques, such as progressive
resizing, have their schedules scaled accordingly).

```{note}
The warmup periods of schedulers are not scaled by the scale schedule ratio.
```


> üöß As general rule, scale schedule can be applied in conjunction with any method. If other methods also perform actions
> according to a schedule, it is important to modify their schedules to coincide with the altered number of epochs.

## Attribution

The number of training steps to perform is an important hyperparameter to tune when developing a model. This technique
appears implicitly throughout the deep learning literature. One example of a systematic study of this approach is the
*scan-SGD* technique in
