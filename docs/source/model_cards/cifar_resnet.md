## Overview

The ResNet model family is a set of convolutional neural networks that can be used as the basis for a variety of vision tasks. CIFAR ResNet models are a subset of this family designed specifically for the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) and [CIFAR-100](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) datasets.

## Attribution

Paper: [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) by He, Zhang, Ren, and Sun 2015. Note that this paper set the standard for ResNet style architectures for both CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet.

## Architecture

Residual Networks are feedforward convolutional networks with "residual" connections between non-consecutive layers.

The model architecture is defined by the original paper:

- The network inputs are of dimension 32Ã—32x3.
- The first layer uses 3Ã—3 convolutions.
- The subsequent layers are a stack of 6n layers with 3Ã—3 convolutions on the feature maps of sizes {32,16,8}, with 2n layers for each feature map size. The number of filters are {16,32,64} for the respective feature map sizes. Subsampling is performed by convolutions with a stride of 2.
- The network ends with a global average pooling, followed by a linear layer with the output dimension equal to the number of classes and a softmax activation.

There are a total 6n+2 stacked weighted layers. Each family member is specified by the number of layers, for example n=9 corresponds to ResNet56.

The biggest differences between CIFAR ResNet models and ImageNet ResNet models are:

- ImageNet ResNets substantially downsample their input compared to CIFAR ResNets. The input layer of ImageNet ResNets is a 7x7 convolutional layer with stride 2, followed shortly thereafter by a 3x3 maxpool with stride 2, after which the input continues on to the convolutional blocks. CIFAR ResNets only have a single 3x3, stride 1, convolutional input layer.
- CIFAR ResNet models use fewer filters for each convolution.
- The ImageNet ResNets contain four stages, while the CIFAR ResNets contain three stages. In addition, CIFAR ResNets uniformly distribute blocks across each stage while ImageNet ResNets have a specific number of blocks for each stage.
