composer.Callback
=================

.. currentmodule:: composer

Callbacks are run at each given :class:`Event`, and are used to for
non-essential recording functions such as logging or timing.

Callbacks differ from :class:`Algorithm` in that
they do not modify the training of the model.
By convention, callbacks should not modify the :class:`State`.


Each callback inherits from the :class:`Callback` base class.
Callbacks can be implemented in two ways:

#.  Override the individual methods named for each :class:`Event`.

    For example,

    .. code-block:: python

        from composer import Callback

        class MyCallback(Callback)

            def epoch_start(self, state: State, logger: Logger):
                print(f'Epoch {state.timer.epoch}')

        
#.  Override :meth:`_run_event` (**not** :meth:`run_event`) to run in response
    to all events. If this method is overridden, then the individual methods
    corresponding to each event name will not be automatically called (however,
    the subclass implementation can invoke these methods as it wishes.)

    For example, 

    .. code-block:: python

        from composer import Callback

        class MyCallback(Callback)

            def _run_event(self, event: Event, state: State, logger: Logger):
                if event == Event.EPOCH_START:
                    print(f'Epoch {state.epoch}/{state.max_epochs}')
